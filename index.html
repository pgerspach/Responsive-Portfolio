                Hello, my name is Patrick Gerspach and welcome to my portfolio site! I am an aspiring web developer/software engineer who has completely changed
                the course of his life in pursuit of a more fulfilling and enjoyable career.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began coding at the University of Notre Dame, where I studied mechanical engineering. My experience started with learning the basics of a now-archaic programming
                language called Fortran. From there, pieces of coding began to slip into my coursework through MatLAB and C, and it didn't take me long to desire 
                to learn more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon finishing my degree and starting work, I almost immediately signed up for the Columbia University Engineering Coding Boot Camp, which I am set to 
                graduate in March. I have learned an incredible amount in such a short time, and my interest has only grown since the onset of my journey. I hope you enjoy
                browsing my projects as much as I enjoyed working on them!
            </p>
